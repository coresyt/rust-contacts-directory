# 📒 Contact Agenda (File-Based) – Requirements

## 🎯 Goal
Build a console-based Python app to manage a contact list, storing data in files (e.g., `.txt` or `.csv`), allowing users to add, view, search, and delete contacts.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Add contact**: Name, phone number, and optionally email.
- **View contacts**: Show all saved contacts.
- **Search**: Find a contact by name or number.
- **Delete**: Remove a contact by name or index.
- **Persistent storage**: Save all contacts in a text or CSV file.
- **File creation**: If the file doesn't exist, the program should create it automatically.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Console interface
- Store data in plain text (`contacts.txt`) or CSV format (`contacts.csv`)
- Use built-in libraries only (`open()`, `csv`, etc.)
- Clear file read/write operations

---

## 💡 Optional Improvements

- Edit/update existing contacts  
- Sort contacts alphabetically  
- Validate phone and email formats  
- Use JSON for structured storage  
- Add search by partial match (e.g., starts with...)  
- GUI version with `tkinter`
